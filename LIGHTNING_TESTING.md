# ‚ö° Lightning Beta Testing Guide

**Private testing branch for Lightning Network integration and LN Markets optimization.**

---

## üéØ **Testing Objectives**

### **Primary Goals:**
1. **Lightning Network Integration** - Test deposit flows and invoice generation
2. **LN Markets API Optimization** - Verify trading execution and error handling  
3. **Production Readiness** - Security review and performance testing
4. **Fee Structure Analysis** - Validate Lightning fees and trading costs

## üß™ **Test Plan for Danny**

### **Phase 1: Lightning Network Testing**
```bash
# Test Lightning invoice creation
./skayn invoice 50000    # Create 50k sat invoice
./skayn invoice 100000   # Create 100k sat invoice
./skayn qr 25000        # Generate QR code

# Check deposit status and flows
./skayn deposit         # View deposit requirements
./skayn balance         # Check current balance
./skayn limits          # Review daily limits
```

**Focus Areas:**
- [ ] Invoice generation speed and accuracy
- [ ] QR code readability and format
- [ ] Deposit detection and confirmation
- [ ] Fee calculation accuracy
- [ ] Error handling for failed payments

### **Phase 2: LN Markets API Integration**
```bash
# Test trading execution
./skayn start           # Start autonomous trading

# Monitor in separate terminal
./live-status.sh        # Check real-time status
./live-panic.sh         # Test emergency stop

# Test individual commands
./skayn force          # Force trading decision
./skayn close-all      # Close all positions
```

**Focus Areas:**
- [ ] API response times and reliability
- [ ] WebSocket connection stability
- [ ] Position opening/closing accuracy
- [ ] Real-time data synchronization
- [ ] Error recovery mechanisms

### **Phase 3: Production Security Review**
```bash
# Test rate limiting protection
# (Run multiple commands quickly to test limits)
./skayn status
./skayn balance  
./skayn status
./skayn balance

# Test panic scenarios
./skayn panic           # Emergency stop request
./skayn confirm-panic   # Execute emergency close
```

**Security Checklist:**
- [ ] API key protection and rotation
- [ ] Rate limiting effectiveness
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Error message information disclosure
- [ ] Session management and timeouts

## üìã **Testing Checklist**

### **Functional Testing**
- [ ] All `./skayn` commands work correctly
- [ ] Lightning invoices generate and display properly
- [ ] Trading execution happens within expected timeframes
- [ ] Panic button closes all positions successfully
- [ ] Live status commands work while agent is running

### **Performance Testing**
- [ ] Price data updates within 90-second cache window
- [ ] API calls respect rate limiting (max 50/hour)
- [ ] Trading decisions execute within 60-second intervals
- [ ] System handles network interruptions gracefully

### **Lightning-Specific Testing**
- [ ] Invoice amounts calculate correctly in sats
