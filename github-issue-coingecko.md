# [SOLVED] CoinGecko API Rate Limiting - Switched to Coinbase API

## Problem
We're constantly getting rate limited by CoinGecko's free API when trying to fetch Bitcoin prices for our autonomous trading agent. This is breaking the trading workflow and forcing us to use simulated prices.

## Current Impact
- **429 Too Many Requests** errors every few minutes
- Trading decisions can't be made with real price data
- Had to implement price simulation as fallback
- Poor user experience during live trading

## What We've Tried
1. ‚úÖ Centralized price service to reduce API calls
2. ‚úÖ 60-second caching to minimize requests
3. ‚úÖ Exponential backoff on rate limit errors
4. ‚úÖ Fallback to simulation when API fails

## Current Workaround
Currently bypassing CoinGecko completely and using simulated prices in the $115k-$125k range to keep the trading agent functional.

## Questions
- Is there a free alternative API that's more generous with rate limits?
- Can we optimize our API usage further without breaking functionality?
- Should we implement multiple API sources as fallbacks?
- Any other Bitcoin price APIs you'd recommend before going paid?

## Ideal Solution
- Free or cheap API with reasonable rate limits (at least 1 call per minute)
- Reliable for production trading (99%+ uptime)
- Real-time or near real-time pricing  
- No subscription required for basic usage

This is blocking our grant application demo since we can't show real trading with live prices. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! üôè

## Technical Details
- **Current usage**: ~1 API call per 60 seconds
- **Rate limit hit**: After just a few calls
- **Error**: `429 Too Many Requests`
- **Fallback**: Simulated prices ($115k-$125k range)

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED
Switched to **Coinbase API** (`https://api.coinbase.com/v2/prices/spot?currency=USD`) which provides:
- ‚úÖ Much more generous rate limits (no issues so far)
- ‚úÖ Clean JSON response format
- ‚úÖ Reliable uptime and performance
- ‚úÖ No authentication required for spot prices
- ‚úÖ Fallback to simulation if API fails

**Result**: Real Bitcoin price data is now working in production! üéâ
